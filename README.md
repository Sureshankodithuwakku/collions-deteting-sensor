🚦 Motorcycle Collision & Accident Detection System

A safety-focused project that uses ESP32 and machine learning to detect collisions and accidents for motorcycles and scooters.
The system leverages real sensor data (normal riding, hit, and accident scenarios) to train a model that can differentiate between normal motion and accidents in real-time.

When an impact is detected, the system:

🚨 Activates an LED alert
🔒 Optionally shuts off the engine to enhance rider safety

📌 Features

    ✔️ Real-time motion data analysis using ESP32
    
    ✔️ ML model trained on normal, hit, and accident data
    
    ✔️ Deployment on Seeed Studio board
    
    ✔️ Collision/accident detection with high accuracy
    
    ✔️ Visual alert via LED indicator
    
    ✔️ Optional engine cutoff mechanism for safety

  

🛠️ Hardware Requirements

  ESP32 development board with seeed
  
  Accelerometer & gyroscope sensors
  
  LED module
  
  Relay module 
  
  Power source 

💻 Software Requirements

  Arduino IDE 
  
  Python (for ML training & preprocessing)
  
  Required Arduino libraries:
    
    Wire.h
    
    sklearn
    
    Adafruit MPU6050



🚀 Usage

  Power on the ESP32 system
  
  Mount the sensors securely on the motorcycle/scooter
  
  During riding, the board continuously monitors live sensor data
  
  If an impact/collision is detected:
  
    LED will blink or stay on 🚨
    
    (Optional) Engine cutoff will be triggered via relay 🔒
  



🔍 Code Review & Improvements

  ✅ What’s Good
  
    Collects 201 samples × 6 features = 1206 values, matching your NUM_FEATURES.
    
    Uses the EloquentTinyML RandomForest model (: ML::Port::RandomForest).
    
    LED indicators are mapped to states (Normal, Accident, Hit).
    
    Proper IMU initialization and error handling.
  
  

⚡Future Improvements
